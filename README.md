Some Ada solutions to Advent of Code 2020.

# Build

You can build the project using the command:

`gnat make -Paoc2020.gpr`

# Run

Executables are in the `exec` folder. They always take 1 argument: the path to
the input puzzle.

If you want to run day 1, use the command:

`path/to/advent_of_code_2020/exec/day01 /path/to/input.txt`

The input files I had are in the `day` folder. Maybe I will remove them.
